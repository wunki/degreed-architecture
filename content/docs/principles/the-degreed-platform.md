Degreed is transitioning from a Software as a Service (Saas) to a Software as a Platform (SaaP) model for our business partners. As a company we want to deliver products to our (internal and external) customers which can be consumed by their own services.

## Implications

* Platform products provide their functionality via (public) APIs; hence, the design of our APIs should be based on the API as a Product principle.

* Treat your API as product and act like a product owner.

* Put yourself into the place of your customers; be an advocate for their needs.

* Emphasize simplicity, comprehensibility, and usability of APIs to make them irresistible for client engineers.

* Actively improve and maintain API consistency over the long term.

* Make use of customer feedback and provide service level support.
