* Spend your time and use your FlexEd to improve yourself as a human and a developer.
* Reach out to your manager if there are tools you need to be more effective as a developer.
* Identify small annoyances in our development process. Thanks to the power of scale, reducing our build time by 10 seconds will add up to hours of time saved per week.
